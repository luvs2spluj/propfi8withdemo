I need to use Chad CN charts throughout the whole site and keep the same functionality as the charts have currently, including allowing the user to have the buckets on the header of the chart to determine what the chart is displaying. Keep the same functionality on the charts and just change the rapper to Chad CN charts with the same functionality integration as the ones that exist now or maybe even more.
